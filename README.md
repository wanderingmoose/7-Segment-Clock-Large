## I forgot I already made a repository of this project. Check other stuff under: FAUX-NEON-7-Segment-Clock.
Have fun with it.

### The interesting effect we are trying to achive is faux neon tube.
### Using fish tank air hose as part of defuser give this faux Neon effect.
### Also used small magnetic wire to hold the tubing against board.
### 3D printed defusers worked good.
### The laser cut parts were orginally done a K40 laser engraver, to had to work within its limits for the board size.

## Lots of pictures below:
